# ADR-118: Cost-Effective Common Crawl Strategy with Sparsifier-Aware Guardrails

**Status**: Phase 1 Active
**Date**: 2026-03-21
**Authors**: RuVector Team
**Deciders**: ruv
**Supersedes**: None
**Related**: ADR-115 (Common Crawl Integration), ADR-116 (Spectral Sparsifier), ADR-096 (Cloud Pipeline), ADR-117 (DragNES Dermatology)

## 1. Context

ADR-115 validated PiQ3 compression (8.68x, 99% recall) and defined a Common Crawl integration architecture. However, the initial cost estimates ($160-480/mo) assume always-on retrieval and Memorystore caching, which is premature for a brain with 1,554 memories.

**Current brain state**:
- 1,554 memories, 340K graph edges
- Sparsifier achieves 27x edge compression (340K -> 12K)
- `/v1/partition` times out: MinCut on 340K edges exceeds Cloud Run's 300s limit
- PiQ3 validated at 8.68x compression, 99% recall
- RlmEmbedder runs on CPU at 128-dim (no GPU or external API needed)

**Problem**: We need a crawl strategy that starts at $11-28/month and scales predictably, with hard guardrails to prevent cost overruns and graph explosion.

## 2. Decision

Implement a three-phase tiered crawl strategy with sparsifier-aware cost guardrails, starting with medical/dermatology domains at $11-28/month.

Key principles:
1. Start minimal, scale only after validating cost/value at each tier
2. Enforce hard daily limits on pages, memories, and Firestore writes
3. Run all partition/MinCut queries on sparsified graphs, never full graphs
4. Cache partition results with background recompute
5. Use RlmEmbedder (CPU, 128-dim) exclusively -- no external embedding APIs

## 3. Three-Phase Budget Model

### Phase 1: Medical Domain ($11-28/mo)

Target: 5K-15K new memories/month from medical and dermatology sources.

| Item | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Cloud Run (crawl job, 30min/day) | $3-8 | Scale-to-zero, bursty pattern |
| Firestore (5K-15K writes + reads) | $2-5 | Document + subcollection ops |
| Cloud Scheduler (2 crawl + 1 partition + 1 cost report) | $0.10 | 4 scheduled jobs |
| GCS (compressed embeddings) | $0.50 | PiQ3-compressed, <1 GB total |
| CDX cache (SQLite on disk) | $0 | Local to Cloud Run instance, ephemeral |
| RlmEmbedder (CPU, 128-dim) | $0 | Runs in-process, no external API |
| Egress (internal only) | $0-5 | Minimal cross-region traffic |
| Cloud Monitoring + alerting | $0.50 | Free tier covers basic alerting |
| Buffer (20%) | $5-10 | Headroom for spikes |
| **Total** | **$11-28** | |

**Domains**: pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, aad.org, jaad.org, nejm.org, lancet.com, bmj.com, dermnetnz.org, skincancer.org, melanoma.org

**Graduation criteria**: Recall >= 0.90 on medical domain queries, cost stable for 30 consecutive days, no partition timeouts.

### Phase 2: Academic + News ($73-108/mo)

Target: 50K-100K new memories/month.

| Item | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Cloud Run (crawl, 2hrs/day) | $15-30 | Higher duty cycle |
| Firestore (50K-100K writes) | $20-30 | Scales with memory count |
| GCS (compressed, ~5-10 GB) | $2-5 | Growth from Phase 1 |
| CDX cache (small Redis or SQLite) | $5-15 | Persistent cache for larger query volume |
| Cloud Scheduler (6 jobs) | $0.30 | Additional domain crawlers |
| Egress | $5-10 | More cross-service traffic |
| Monitoring | $1 | Additional alert rules |
| Buffer (20%) | $15-20 | |
| **Total** | **$73-108** | |

**Additional domains**: arxiv.org, en.wikipedia.org, techcrunch.com, arstechnica.com, nature.com, science.org

**Graduation criteria**: Phase 1 metrics sustained, graph sharding design validated, budget approved by owner.

### Phase 3: Broad Web ($158-308/mo)

Target: 500K-1M new memories/month via WET segment processing.

| Item | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Cloud Run (crawl + ingest, 4hrs/day) | $40-80 | WET segment processing |
| Firestore (500K-1M writes) | $50-100 | Significant write volume |
| GCS (compressed, 50-100 GB) | $5-15 | Larger corpus |
| CDX cache (Redis 4 GiB) | $30-60 | High query volume |
| Cloud Scheduler (10+ jobs) | $0.50 | Multiple domain schedulers |
| Egress | $10-20 | |
| Monitoring | $2-3 | |
| Buffer (20%) | $25-50 | |
| **Total** | **$158-308** | |

**Graduation criteria**: Phase 2 metrics sustained, graph sharding operational, aggressive sparsification validated at 2M+ edges.

## 4. Cost Guardrails

Hard limits enforced at the application layer. These are not suggestions -- the crawl pipeline must check and enforce these before every operation.

```rust
/// Cost guardrails enforced by the crawl pipeline.
/// These prevent runaway spending by capping daily operations.
pub struct CostGuardrails {
    /// Maximum pages fetched from Common Crawl CDX per day.
    /// Prevents bandwidth and compute spikes.
    pub max_pages_per_day: u32,

    /// Maximum new memories created per day (after dedup + novelty filter).
    /// Controls Firestore write costs and graph growth rate.
    pub max_new_memories_per_day: u32,

    /// Edge count threshold that triggers aggressive sparsification.
    /// Prevents MinCut timeout by keeping partition graph small.
    pub max_graph_edges: u64,

    /// Hard cap on Firestore write operations per day.
    /// Direct cost control for the largest variable cost item.
    pub max_firestore_writes_per_day: u32,

    /// USD threshold that triggers budget alert via Cloud Monitoring.
    /// When monthly projection exceeds this, crawl jobs are paused.
    pub budget_alert_threshold_usd: f64,

    /// Novelty threshold for deduplication.
    /// Skip ingestion if cosine similarity to existing memory > (1 - threshold).
    /// Default 0.05 means skip if cosine > 0.95.
    pub novelty_threshold: f32,
}

impl CostGuardrails {
    /// Phase 1: Medical domain, minimal spend
    pub fn phase1() -> Self {
        Self {
            max_pages_per_day: 500,
            max_new_memories_per_day: 200,
            max_graph_edges: 500_000,
            max_firestore_writes_per_day: 5_000,
            budget_alert_threshold_usd: 30.0,
            novelty_threshold: 0.05,
        }
    }

    /// Phase 2: Academic + news, moderate spend
    pub fn phase2() -> Self {
        Self {
            max_pages_per_day: 5_000,
            max_new_memories_per_day: 2_000,
            max_graph_edges: 2_000_000,
            max_firestore_writes_per_day: 50_000,
            budget_alert_threshold_usd: 120.0,
            novelty_threshold: 0.05,
        }
    }

    /// Phase 3: Broad web, higher limits
    pub fn phase3() -> Self {
        Self {
            max_pages_per_day: 20_000,
            max_new_memories_per_day: 10_000,
            max_graph_edges: 5_000_000,
            max_firestore_writes_per_day: 200_000,
            budget_alert_threshold_usd: 350.0,
            novelty_threshold: 0.05,
        }
    }

    /// Returns true if the content should be skipped (too similar to existing)
    pub fn should_skip(&self, cosine_similarity: f32) -> bool {
        cosine_similarity > (1.0 - self.novelty_threshold)
    }
}
```

### Guardrail Enforcement Points

| Checkpoint | Guardrail | Action on Breach |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Before CDX query | `max_pages_per_day` | Skip crawl, log warning |
| Before memory creation | `max_new_memories_per_day` | Queue for next day |
| After memory creation | `max_graph_edges` | Trigger aggressive sparsification |
| Before Firestore write | `max_firestore_writes_per_day` | Buffer to next day |
| Hourly cost projection | `budget_alert_threshold_usd` | Pause all crawl jobs, alert owner |
| Before embedding comparison | `novelty_threshold` | Skip duplicate, log |

## 5. Sparsifier-Aware Graph Management

The spectral sparsifier (ADR-116) is critical for keeping partition queries fast and costs low.

### Edge Threshold Policy

| Edge Count | Action | Sparsifier Epsilon | Expected Sparse Edges |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| < 100K | Partition on full graph | N/A | N/A |
| 100K - 500K | Partition on sparsified graph | 0.3 (default) | ~4K-18K |
| 500K - 2M | Aggressive sparsification | 0.5 | ~10K-40K |
| > 2M | Graph sharding + aggressive sparsify | 0.7 + shard | ~6K-30K per shard |

### Partition on Sparsified Graph

**Rule**: All MinCut/partition queries MUST use sparsified edges when `edge_count > 100K`.

The sparsifier preserves cut structure (spectral guarantee) while reducing edge count by 20-30x. This is not an approximation shortcut -- it is a mathematically justified reduction that preserves the properties MinCut needs.

**Current example**: 340K edges -> 12K sparsified (27x). MinCut on 12K edges completes in ~5-15 seconds vs timeout on 340K.

## 6. Partition Caching Strategy

### Problem
`/v1/partition` computes MinCut on every request. At 340K edges, this exceeds Cloud Run's 300-second timeout.

### Solution: Cache + Background Recompute

```rust
/// Cached partition result, stored in Firestore or in-memory.
/// Served directly on /v1/partition requests.
pub struct CachedPartition {
    /// The computed cluster assignments
    pub clusters: Vec<Cluster>,
    /// When this partition was computed
    pub computed_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    /// Cache TTL in seconds (default: 3600 = 1 hour)
    pub ttl_seconds: u64,
    /// Whether this was computed on the sparsified graph
    pub used_sparsified: bool,
    /// Number of edges used in computation
    pub edge_count: u64,
    /// Sparsifier epsilon used
    pub epsilon: f32,
}

impl CachedPartition {
    /// Check if cached result is still valid
    pub fn is_valid(&self) -> bool {
        let elapsed = Utc::now() - self.computed_at;
        elapsed.num_seconds() < self.ttl_seconds as i64
    }
}
```

### Request Flow

```
GET /v1/partition
  |
  v
[Cache hit + valid?] --yes--> Return cached result (< 10ms)
  |
  no
  |
  v
[Sparsified edges available?] --yes--> Compute on sparse (5-15s)
  |                                      |
  no                                     v
  |                                   Cache result, return
  v
[Edge count < 100K?] --yes--> Compute on full graph
  |
  no
  |
  v
Return 503 "Partition computing, try again in 60s"
  + Trigger background recompute
```

### Alert Escalation

| Condition | Action | Notification |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Daily spend > $2 | Log warning | Cloud Monitoring -> Slack |
| Weekly spend > $15 | Reduce `max_pages_per_day` by 50% | Email alert |
| Monthly projection > `budget_alert_threshold_usd` | Pause all crawl jobs | Email + Slack + brain memory |
| Graph edges > 80% of `max_graph_edges` | Trigger aggressive sparsification | Log info |
| Graph edges > 100% of `max_graph_edges` | Pause memory creation, sparsify | Cloud Monitoring alert |

### Audit Trail

The weekly cost report (triggered by `brain-cost-report` scheduler job) is shared as a brain memory, creating an immutable audit trail of spending over time.

## 9. Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Cost Impact |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Download full WET segments in Phase 1 | Each segment is 100+ MB compressed; thousands per crawl | $1,000+/mo |
| Use external embedding APIs (OpenAI, Cohere) | Millions of embeddings at $0.0001-0.001 each | $500+/mo |
| Skip novelty filtering | Graph explodes with near-duplicate memories | Firestore + compute spiral |
| Run MinCut on full graph (>100K edges) | O(V*E*log V) exceeds Cloud Run 300s timeout | Timeout errors |
| Store raw HTML in Firestore | Average page is 50-100KB; Firestore charges per byte | $500+/mo at scale |
| Use GPU for RlmEmbedder | 128-dim HashEmbedder is CPU-efficient by design | $200+/mo unnecessary |
| Skip sparsification before partition | Full graph partition is ~100x slower than sparsified | Wasted compute |
| No daily caps | A bug or config error can drain budget in hours | Unbounded |

## 12. Phase 1 Implementation Notes (2026-03-22)

### 12.1 Scheduler Jobs Deployed

The following Cloud Scheduler jobs are defined for Phase 1:

| Job Name | Schedule | Target | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| `brain-crawl-medical` | Daily 2AM UTC | `/v1/pipeline/crawl/ingest` (6 medical domains) | Defined |
| `brain-crawl-derm` | Daily 3AM UTC | `/v1/pipeline/crawl/ingest` (5 dermatology domains) | Defined |
| `brain-partition-recompute` | Hourly | `/v1/partition/recompute` (sparsified) | Defined |
| `brain-cost-report` | Weekly Sunday 6AM UTC | `/v1/pipeline/cost/report` | Defined |

### 12.2 CDX Pipeline Issue

The CDX pipeline successfully queries Common Crawl indices and retrieves WARC content via range-GET. However, the HTML extractor returns empty titles when parsing Wayback Machine archived content. The archived HTML structure differs from live pages (different DOM layout, missing meta tags, Wayback toolbar injection). This does not block discovery but degrades content quality for automated ingestion.

**Workaround**: Use the direct inject pipeline for curated content until the HTML extractor is updated to handle archived HTML formats.

### 12.3 Direct Inject Workaround

The direct inject pipeline via `POST /v1/discover` with `inject: true` is fully operational and was used as the primary import method for Phase 1. Key details:

- The `inject: true` flag is **required** in the discover request body for content to be stored (not just indexed)
- Batch inject supports a `source` field on each item for provenance tracking
- Each item in the batch should include: `title`, `body`, `source`, and optionally `tags`
- This pipeline bypasses CDX/WARC entirely, making it suitable for curated and pre-processed content

### 12.4 Cost: Actual vs Projected

| Metric | Projected (Phase 1) | Actual (2026-03-22) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Monthly budget | $11-28 | ~$3-7 so far |
| Memories imported | 5K-15K/month target | 1,588 total |
| Graph edges | Up to 500K limit | 372,210 |
| Sparsifier compression | ~27x expected | 28.7x actual |
| Firestore writes | Up to 5K/day | Well under limit |

Cost is significantly below projections because direct inject avoids the heavier CDX+WARC compute path. As automated scheduler jobs ramp up, costs will approach the projected $11-28/month range.
